Welcome to some statistical tests over Yelp's open dataset.

#Setup: What you will need
- Python 2.X
- Scikit-learn
- Yelp academic data set

#Hypothesis: 
Based on rating of a resturant, we can find which features best describe that classification 

#Testing:
To do so we have implemented Classification And Regression Trees (CART) to weight features and find the most descriptive attributes.

Still WIP, more to come!
